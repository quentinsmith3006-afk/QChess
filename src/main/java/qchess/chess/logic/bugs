New algorithm idea for checkmate

Store all the checkable pieces in a arraylist in chessboard



cross reference the checkable piece's moves with the moves at the start
then do it in sequence as each move is clicked.

set chess position boolean beingAttacked to true --> prevents having to cross reference


When promoting to something, it must check if the other team is now in check after the promotion

Checkmate occurs prematurely even if a piece can block it

Pinning is not fully implemented or doesnt work


Jan 2nd 2026
Checkmate no longer occurs prematurely and pinning is no longer an issue.



(fixed)
New bug: When a piece "blocks" an attack, it cna block at anypoint of that vector including behind the king

(fixed)
Bug fixed, attack vectors surround King even when a piece is pinned


Enpassant is shown even when it isn't a playable piece if you disable switch teams. (Fixed)

Pieces can hit the enpassant piece if disabled switch teams. (Fixed)

Pieces can't move along the attacking vector when they are pinned (fixed)

Doesn't check board for a initial check/checkmate if enabled
-> After I implement this


I need to add stalemate



bug w/ checkmate
Basically the king is getting sloppy seconds from pastChessPositions which is worn and used by several
pieces. So you cannot make numMoves reliant on pastChessPositions and it must be directly incremented
inside of the refinery. The same thing goes for other pieces except it will still work in practice, its
just that the number of moves wont be accurate at all.
