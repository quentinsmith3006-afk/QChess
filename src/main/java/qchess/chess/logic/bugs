New algorithm idea for checkmate

Store all the checkable pieces in a arraylist in chessboard



cross reference the checkable piece's moves with the moves at the start
then do it in sequence as each move is clicked.

set chess position boolean beingAttacked to true --> prevents having to cross reference


When promoting to something, it must check if the other team is now in check after the promotion

Checkmate occurs prematurely even if a piece can block it

Pinning is not fully implemented or doesnt work
