New algorithm idea for checkmate

Store all the checkable pieces in a arraylist in chessboard



cross reference the checkable piece's moves with the moves at the start
then do it in sequence as each move is clicked.

set chess position boolean beingAttacked to true --> prevents having to cross reference


When promoting to something, it must check if the other team is now in check after the promotion



Jan 1st 2026
Checkmate occurs prematurely even if a piece can block it

Pinning is not fully implemented or doesnt work


Jan 2nd 2026
Checkmate no longer occurs prematurely and pinning is no longer an issue.



(fixed)
New bug: When a piece "blocks" an attack, it cna block at anypoint of that vector including behind the king

(fixed)
Bug fixed, attack vectors surround King even when a piece is pinned


Enpassant is shown even when it isn't a playable piece if you disable switch teams. (Fixed)

Pieces can hit the enpassant piece if disabled switch teams. (Fixed)

Pieces can't move along the attacking vector when they are pinned (fixed)

Doesn't check board for a initial check/checkmate if enabled (fixed)

jan 03
A piece can be pinned to its own Checkable (Fixed)

Pieces can pin same piece teams to opposite team Checkables (fixed)

jan 04
black pawns  cant move at the bottom most row (fixed)
White pawns  cant move at the top most row (fixed)

When pieces promote, checkables dont automatically adjust their playables (fixed)

When checking a checkable, the checkable sides attacks displayed (fixed)

Attack squares can go through same-team pieces (bad) (fixed maybe)

Kings can touch if the king has a supporting piece ?? HOW DO I REPRODUCE IT BRUH (fixed)

If pieces are equidistant from the king as is the checking piece, those pieces can move (Can't reproduce)

castling bug where KING can't be placed on sides b/c castle vector breaks (fixed)

numMoves doesn't count specify captures (Fixed)

Jan 05

Chess pieces can still capture on their own enpassant squares. I suspect it has smt to do with memoize (fixed)

Chessmen can still pin their fellow brethren (fixed)

Checkmate is still broken -> Some pieces moves are not counted leading to premature checkmate call (fixed but I dont like the fix)

If playing on single team (black), the attack squares are enabled causing the checkables to not be able to move (fixed)

Make sure users of the API can access all chess pieces (done)

Make sure there is a way to handle pieces who can move on their castle pos (nah)





-> After I implement this





NEW FEATURES TO BE ADDED
Add a way to reset the chessboard.

I need to add stalemate -> mainly the stalemate event activate whenever stalemate condition occurs (done probably - untested)

Chess notation -> I should be able to place and make chessmen using this and import chess games. (all I need to do is test this)

Chess 960 board and ability to implement 960 castling (hard)

I think thats all I want to add tbh
