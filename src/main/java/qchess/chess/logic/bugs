NEW FEATURES TO BE ADDED
Add a way to reset the chessboard.

I need to add stalemate -> mainly the stalemate event activate whenever stalemate condition occurs (done probably - untested)

Chess notation -> I should be able to place and make chessmen using this and import chess games. (all I need to do is test this)

I think thats all I want to add tbh

{ If I have time:
add the ability to add fractional vectors

add the ability to add annotations to Specify capture vectors

Chess 960 board and ability to implement 960 castling (hard)
}



what happens if you put a pawn on its promotion rank at the start
