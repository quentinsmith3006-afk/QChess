New algorithm idea for checkmate

Store all the checkable pieces in a arraylist in chessboard



cross reference the checkable piece's moves with the moves at the start
then do it in sequence as each move is clicked.

set chess position boolean beingAttacked to true --> prevents having to cross reference
